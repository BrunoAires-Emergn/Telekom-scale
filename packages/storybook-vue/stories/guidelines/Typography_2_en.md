## Hierarchy through typography

Clearly distinguishable font hierarchies provide orientation and make important information immediately apparent.

Example 1: The focus on the headline with lead text (Body large) allows for a smooth transition into the content. The left alignment supports the flow of reading.

Example 2: Section headings help easily structure more complex content.

## Legibility

### Line spacing

Longer body text is easier to read if the line spacing is slightly increased. For text with more than three lines, use the "Body long" format (TeleNeo Regular 16 px with 24 px line spacing).

Short texts are easier to grasp when they appear more compact.
For just a few lines, use the "Body short" format (TeleNeo Regular 16 px with 20 px line spacing).

### Line length

Lines that are too long tire readers out. Lines that are too short make it difficult to read the text.
The table of font formats shows our recommendations for the appropriate line length for different font sizes.

The line of a headline with the size Heading 01 should consist of approx. 30 - 50 characters. Avoid multi-line headlines.

A line of copy text (here: Body short) should consist of minimum 25 and maximum 80-100 characters.
