# Colors

Color design is one of the decisive factors for our overall visual appearance and brand recognition. With our brand color, Magenta, Deutsche Telekom is one of the few companies that can be recognized internationally by its color alone. This is why Magenta is always the dominant color in our visual appearance. To create a lively and interesting visual appearance, we can add more colors â€“ as long as they harmonize with Magenta.
