# Typography

Typography has a huge influence on the usability and functionality of our interfaces. It helps us guide users through a product or service.

## General

In addition to our color and logo, the TeleNeo font is a central design element for our brand recognition. To make a lasting impact on the customer experience, use our corporate font for the written word in all our products and services.

The [Liquid Design Brand Concept](https://www.brand-design.telekom.com/en/articles/l/liquid-brand-design-concept/) gives us the freedom and flexibility to adapt our font to the particular target group and context. You can find detailed information about TeleNeo, including formats, best practices, character sets, and range of functionality, in the article [Typography](https://www.brand-design.telekom.com/en/articles/t/typography/).

## TeleNeo font styles

TeleNeo has five font styles that are evenly graded in terms of weight. When used properly, they emphasize and clarify the content hierarchy. Each font style is also available as italics. Use the italic style only as an exception, e.g., for references in quotations or something similar.

Scale contains standard colors for texts, text links, and user feedback like error and success messages.
